The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment, with millions of confirmed cases, business slowdowns and shutdowns, and market volatility. COVID-19 has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, significant economic disruption and is having widespread, rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, financial markets and business practices. Various governments around the world previously implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including 
social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, supply chain logistical changes, and closure of non-essential businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our business operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. There is substantial uncertainty regarding the duration and degree of COVID-19&#8217;s continued effects over time. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic or recurrence thereof, deployment and administration of vaccines, governmental, business and individuals&#8217; actions in response to the pandemic and impact on economic activity, including possible recession or financial market instability. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) and Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding potential risks to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic.
We sell our security and inspection systems and healthcare products primarily to end-users, while we design and manufacture our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems and provide electronics manufacturing services primarily for OEM customers.
A variety of technologies are currently used globally in security and inspection applications, including transmission and backscatter X-ray, 3-D and computed tomography, radiation detection, metal detection, radar, millimeter wave imaging, chemical explosive trace detection, and optical inspection. We believe that the market for security and inspection products will continue to be affected by the threat of terrorist incidents, drug trafficking, gun violence, and by new government mandates and appropriations for security and inspection products in the United States and internationally.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and international air transportation security regulators around the world require the screening of air cargo. Several of our screening systems have been approved by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Transportation Security Administration, as well as by various international regulatory bodies, for this purpose and are being procured and used by freight forwarders, airlines, airports, transportation companies and other businesses to fulfill their compliance requirements. These and other regulations promulgated by international organizations have resulted in an ongoing global demand for airline, cargo, port and border security and inspection technologies. 
While we believe that the healthcare industry will continue to grow throughout much of the world, many factors are forcing healthcare providers to do more with less. These factors include stricter government requirements affecting staffing and accountability and uncertainty around potential U.S. healthcare legislation. The COVID-19 pandemic has strained healthcare provider resources, placing increased focus on the advantages of remote monitoring and products which can be deployed flexibly, enabling hospitals to quickly reconfigure and adapt to unexpected change. Our customers expect clinical value, economic value, and clinical decision support. Positioning our current healthcare products to demonstrate the competitive value in total cost of ownership is increasingly important in this environment. At the same time, the widespread introduction of mobile devices into the healthcare environment is creating an 
emerging demand for patient data acquisition and distribution. Our Healthcare division designs, manufactures and markets devices and software that respond to these factors, helping hospitals reduce costs, make better-informed clinical decisions, and more fully utilize resources.
We are a global manufacturer and distributor of patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, and connected care solutions for use in hospitals, medical clinics and physician offices. We design, manufacture and market patient monitoring solutions for critical, sub-acute and perioperative care areas of the hospital, wired and wireless networks and ambulatory blood pressure monitors, all aimed at providing caregivers with timely patient information. Our cardiology and remote monitoring systems include Holter recorders and analyzers, ambulatory blood pressure monitors, resting and stress electrocardiography (ECG) devices, and ECG management software systems and related software and services.
We believe that continued advances in technology and reductions in the cost of key components of optoelectronic systems, including computer processing power and memory, have broadened the optoelectronics market by enabling the use of optoelectronic devices in a greater number of applications. In addition, we see a trend among OEMs&#160;to increasingly outsource the design and manufacture of optoelectronic devices as well as value-added subsystems to fully-integrated, independent manufacturers, like us, that may have greater specialization, broader expertise and more flexibility to respond to short cycle times and quicker market expectations.
Our optoelectronic devices are used in a wide variety of applications for diversified markets including aerospace and defense, avionics, medical imaging and diagnostics, biochemistry analysis, pharmaceutical, nanotechnology, telecommunications, construction and homeland security. Medical applications for our devices include diagnostic and imaging products, patient monitoring equipment, and glucose monitors.

We also believe that we offer significant added value to our customers by providing a full range of vertically-integrated services, including component design and customization, subsystem concept design and application engineering, product development and prototyping, efficient pre-production and short-run manufacturing and competitive mass production capabilities. We believe that our vertical integration differentiates us from many of our competitors and provides value to our customers who can rely on us to be an integrated supplier.
 The trend toward increased screening of goods entering and departing from ports and borders has resulted, and may continue to result in, the growth in the market for cargo inspection systems and turnkey security screening services that are capable of inspecting shipping containers for contraband and assisting customs officials in the verification of shipping manifests. Package and cargo screening by freight forwarders, airlines and air cargo companies represents a growing sector, as regulations in the United States and Europe have continued to require screening of air cargo shipments. We plan to capitalize on opportunities to replace, service and upgrade existing security installations, and to offer turnkey security screening solutions in which we may construct, staff and/or operate on a long-term basis security screening checkpoints for our customers. 
We expect that a market for software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms that are capable of integrating the data that our security inspection systems produce with related information derived from vehicle plates, cargo container numbers, drivers&#8217; licenses, government databases, and other sources will also continue to develop, mature and grow, particularly as customers shift their operating procedures to take advantage of secure, cloud-based, networking technologies. We are a leader in the development of integrating non-intrusive inspection with such sources and to transmit such data to operators working within secure, remote screening facilities. Since 2011, our software has been used by customs and tax authorities in the United States, Europe and Latin America to screen over one million containers and vehicles. In the future, we believe that government agencies and commercial customers may increasingly rely on such SaaS offerings to remotely review and adjudicate screening decisions over secure networks as well as to communicate with and monitor the performance of inspectors working on the ground at distant ports, border crossings and other checkpoints.
We develop and market patient monitoring systems, cardiology and remote monitoring products, and connected care systems and associated supplies and accessories. Our efforts to develop new products and improve our existing medical technologies are focused on the needs of healthcare organizations, caregivers, and their patients. Our efforts to improve existing medical technologies concentrate on providing products that are flexible and intuitive to use so that clinicians can deliver accurate, precise, reliable and cost-effective care.
We intend to continue to selectively enter new markets that complement our existing capabilities in the design, development and manufacture of specialized electronic systems and components for critical applications such as security inspection, patient monitoring and cardiology and remote monitoring. We believe that by manufacturing products that rely on our existing technological capabilities, we will leverage our integrated design and manufacturing infrastructure to build a larger presence in new markets that present attractive competitive dynamics. We intend to achieve this strategy through internal growth and through selective acquisitions.
Acquiring New Technologies and Companies. 
We design, develop, manufacture and sell products ranging from security and inspection systems to patient monitoring and cardiology and remote monitoring systems to discrete optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems.
We design, manufacture and market security and inspection systems globally to end users under the &#8220;Rapiscan Systems,&#8221; &#8220;AS&amp;E,&#8221; and &#8220;Gatekeeper&#8221; trade names. Our Security products are used to inspect baggage, parcels, cargo, people, vehicles and other objects for various contraband and prohibited items including weapons, explosives, drugs, and radioactive and nuclear materials. These systems are also used for the safe, accurate and efficient verification of cargo manifests for the purpose of assessing duties and monitoring the export and import of controlled materials. Our Security products fall into the following categories: baggage and parcel inspection; cargo and vehicle inspection; hold (checked) baggage screening; people screening; radiation detection; &#160;explosive and narcotics trace detection; and optical inspection systems. We also offer turnkey security screening services, as well as related software integration platforms, operator training, and the staffing and operation of security screening checkpoints under the &#8220;S2&#8221; trade name. From time to time we form joint ventures to carry out our operations in certain geographies, including, for example, Albania.
Many of our security and inspection systems utilize dual-energy X-ray imaging technology with computer software enhanced imaging methods to facilitate the detection of materials and items such as explosives, weapons, narcotics, bulk currency or other contraband. In addition, many of our systems use dual-view X-ray imaging, which allows operators to examine objects from two directions simultaneously, thereby reducing the need for re-scanning of objects and improving the operator&#8217;s ability to detect threats quickly and effectively. Our baggage and parcel inspection, cargo and vehicle inspection and hold (checked) baggage screening inspection systems range in size from compact mobile systems to large systems comprising entire buildings in which trucks, shipping containers or pallets are inspected. Many of our inspection systems are also designed to be upgradeable to respond to new customer requirements as they emerge or change.
Our cargo and vehicle inspection applications, in which vehicles, cars, trucks, shipping containers, pallets and other large objects can be inspected, are designed in various configurations, including gantry, portal and mobile systems. These products are primarily used to verify the contents of cars, trucks or cargo containers and to detect the presence of contraband, including narcotics, weapons, explosives, radioactive and nuclear materials and other smuggled items. Most of our cargo and vehicle inspection systems employ X-ray imaging to non-intrusively inspect objects and present images to an inspector, showing shapes, sizes, locations and relative densities of the contents. These systems utilize transmission imaging technology, backscatter imaging technology, or both technologies. We also manufacture passive radiation detection devices for detecting nuclear threat material utilizing their gamma and neutron signatures. Additionally, we have developed isotope-specific identification algorithms. Many of these systems have been built to meet specific customer inspection requirements.
Our Security division offers a range of systems that use different types of x-ray imaging, for example dual-view, multi-view or computed tomography, to provide image data to detection algorithms that allow the automated detection of a range of threat items and materials. Typical threat items include explosives, narcotics and weapons. In many cases these systems are designed to meet the regulated detection requirements of relevant bodies such as the U.S. Transportation Security Administration and the European Union. Such automated detection systems are targeted towards applications such as hold baggage screening, cabin baggage screening and air cargo screening, and approvals from those bodies are recognized and used as de facto standards globally with few exceptions.
Our Security division also offers trace detection systems that are designed to detect trace amounts of explosives as well as narcotics. We also offer people screening products, such as walk-through metal detector (WTMD) products for use at security checkpoints at airports, government buildings, sports arenas and other venues. These systems are designed to be used in screening people, baggage and other items for illicit materials and weapons. 
Our Healthcare division designs, manufactures and markets products globally to end users primarily under the &#8220;Spacelabs&#8221; trade name.
Spacelabs products include patient monitors for use in perioperative, critical care and emergency care environments with neonatal, pediatric and adult patients. Our patient monitoring systems such as Xprezzon
 are supported by surveillance systems connected by wireless or hardwired networks, as well as standalone monitors that enable patient data to be transported physically from one monitor to another as the patient is moved. These systems enable hospital staff to access patient data where and when it is required. In addition, these products are designed to interact with hospital information systems.
Spacelabs SafeNSound&#8482; assists hospitals in providing value-based care by streamlining workflows and improving communications.

Our current patents will expire at various times between 2022 and 2040. While we continue to file new applications and pursue new patents, it remains possible that pending patent applications or other applications that may be filed may not result in issued patents. In addition, issued patents may not survive challenges to their validity or enforceability, or may be found to not be infringed by any third parties. Although we believe that our patents have value, our patents, or any additional patents that may be issued in the future, may not be able to provide meaningful protection from competition.
 trademarks, the impact of the loss of any single trademark or patent would not likely have a material adverse effect on our business.
The patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, and connected care systems we design, manufacture, and market are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, principally the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and by other federal, state, local and foreign authorities. These systems are also subject to various U.S. and foreign product performance and safety standards. Our medical device product candidates must undergo an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the United States and other countries, including submission demonstrating clinical safety and efficacy of intended use, as well as the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.This may require significant interaction with regulatory agencies and the expenditure of substantial resources.
In the United States, the FDA has broad regulatory powers with respect to pre-clinical and clinical testing of new medical devices and the designing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, federal law and FDA regulations require that all new or significantly modified medical devices introduced into the market be preceded either by a pre-market notification clearance order under section&#160;510(k)&#160;of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), or an approved pre-market approval (PMA) application. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes&#8212;Class&#160;I, Class&#160;II or Class&#160;III&#8212;depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness. Class&#160;I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation (QSR) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Some Class&#160;I devices, also called Class&#160;I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k)&#160;premarket notification process described below. Most Class&#160;I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class&#160;II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls as deemed necessary by the FDA, which can include performance standards, guidelines and post-market surveillance. Most Class&#160;II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class&#160;II devices is accomplished through the 510(k)&#160;premarket notification process.
Under the 510(k)&#160;process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the product for which clearance has been sought is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k)&#160;device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May&#160;28, 1976 for which the FDA had not yet called for the submission of pre-market approval applications. After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. In that case, the applicant must correct the submission errors before resubmitting. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of, and clear or deny, a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. The FDA may formally request additional information, which may toll or restart the 90 day deadline. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer than 90 days and sometimes is not granted at all. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
To be substantially equivalent, the proposed device must have a substantially equivalent intended use and indications for use as the predicate device, and either have substantially equivalent technological characteristics to the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support the demonstration of substantial equivalence. Multiple interactions and/or the submission of additional information or documentation may be required to secure regulatory clearance.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination that a new submission is not required, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite premarket notification or PMA submissions.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are typically subject to the PMA application process, which is more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process and requires substantial clinical data. To date, all of the patient monitoring and cardiology and remote monitoring systems we manufacture and sell in the United States have required only 510(k) pre-market notification clearance.
FDA clearance or approval, when granted, may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed, and such product approvals, once granted, may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing. Manufacturers of FDA-regulated products are subject to pervasive and continuing post-approval governmental regulation, including, but not limited to, the registration and listing regulation, which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution; Quality System (also known as Good Manufacturing Practices) Regulations, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, risk management, validation, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; product and promotional labeling regulations; advertising and promotion requirements; restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device; PMA annual reporting requirements; the FDA&#8217;s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses; the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur; medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; an order of repair, replacement or refund; device tracking requirements; and post-approval study and post-market surveillance requirements. The FDA has also established a Unique Device Identification (&#8220;UDI&#8221;) system that requires manufacturers to mark certain medical devices distributed in the United States with unique device identifiers. Also, we must comply with cybersecurity requirements to assess cybersecurity and safety risks and design and develop our devices to ensure safe and effective performance in the face of cyber threats. It is also incumbent on us to monitor third party software for new vulnerabilities and verify and validate any software updates or patches meant to address vulnerabilities.
Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled and unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA&#8217;s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA&#8217;s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness therapies, technology assessments and managed care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States, Europe and Asia. As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies. In addition, because there is generally no separate reimbursement from third-party payers to our customers for many of our products, the additional costs associated with the use of our products can impact the profit margin of our customers. Accordingly, these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over healthcare products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.
Healthcare cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical devices to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power, and this trend is expected to continue. The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past. These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing.
Significant healthcare reforms have had an impact on medical device manufacturer and hospital revenues. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, is a sweeping measure designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, control healthcare spending and improve healthcare quality. Many states have also adopted or are considering changes in healthcare policies, in part due to state budgetary pressures. Ongoing uncertainty regarding implementation of certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act makes it difficult to predict the impact the Affordable Care Act or state law proposals may have on our business. This has created uncertainty in the market, which could result in reduced demand for our products, additional pricing pressure, and increased demand for new and more flexible payment structures.
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, data privacy and security laws, anti-kickback and false claims laws, and transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
As a participant in the healthcare industry, we are subject to extensive regulations protecting the privacy and security of patient health information that we receive, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (collectively, &#8220;HIPAA&#8221;). Among other things, these regulations impose extensive requirements for maintaining the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, known as &#8220;protected health information.&#8221; The HIPAA privacy regulations do not preempt state laws and regulations relating to personal information that may also apply to us. Our failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to civil and criminal sanctions.
The HIPAA provisions also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Further, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#8220;any request or demand&#8221; for money or property presented to the U.S. Government. Medical device manufacturers have been held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing customers with inaccurate billing or coding information.
These laws impact the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals or other potential purchasers of our products. They particularly impact how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting, research grants and other service arrangements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to material penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Additionally, there has been a trend towards increased federal and state regulation of payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires that certain device manufacturers track and report to the government information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians, certain other clinical staff, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer&#8217;s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties for &#8220;knowing failures.&#8221; Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.
We are subject to similar laws in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, within the EU, the control of unlawful marketing activities is a matter of national law in each of the member states. The member states of the EU closely monitor perceived unlawful marketing activity by companies. We could face civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions if any member state determines that we have breached our obligations under its national laws. Industry associations also closely monitor the activities of member companies. If these organizations or authorities name us as having breached our obligations under their regulations, rules&#160;or standards, our reputation would suffer, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.
We are also subject to regulation in the foreign countries in which we manufacture, market, and/or import our products. For example, the commercialization of certain products, including medical devices, in the EU is regulated under a system that presently requires all such products sold in the EU to bear the CE marking&#8212;an international symbol of adherence to the medical device regulations and standards of the EU. Our manufacturing facilities in Hawthorne, California; Snoqualmie, Washington; Johor Bahru, Malaysia; Batam, Indonesia; and Hyderabad, India are all certified to the International Organization for Standardization&#8217;s ISO 13485 standard for quality management. Our Hawthorne, California and Snoqualmie, Washington facilities are also certified to the requirements of Annex II, section 3 of the Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices, which allows them to self-certify that manufactured products can bear the CE marking. Further, the implementation of the Restriction of Hazardous Substance Directive (&#8220;ROHS&#8221;) requires that certain products, including medical devices, shipped into the EU eliminate targeted ROHS substances.
Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have a transition time to meet the requirements of the MDR.&#160;The MDR differs in several important ways from the EU&#8217;s current directives for medical devices and active implantable medical devices. The most significant changes in the regulation include:
We have a dedicated team updating and revising key systems, processes, and product technical documentation to meet the new MDR requirements and transition timeline.
We are subject to various environmental laws, directives, and regulations pertaining to the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances used, and hazardous wastes generated, in the manufacture of our products. Such laws mandate the use of controls and practices designed to mitigate the impact of our operations on the environment, and under such laws we may be held liable for the costs associated with the remediation and removal of any unintended or previously unknown releases of hazardous substances on, beneath or from our property and associated operations, including the remediation of hazardous waste disposed off-site. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such hazardous substances. Any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We believe that, except to an extent that would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, we are currently in compliance with all environmental regulations in connection with our manufacturing operations, and that we have obtained all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business. The amount of hazardous substances used, and hazardous wastes generated, by us may increase in the future depending on changes in our operations. To ensure compliance and practice proper due diligence, we conduct appropriate environmental audits and investigations at our manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe, and, to the extent practicable, on all new properties. Our manufacturing facilities conduct regular internal audits to ensure proper environmental permits and controls are in place to meet changes in operations. Third-party investigations address matters related to current and former occupants and operations, historical land use, and regulatory oversight and status of associated properties and/or operations (including surrounding properties). The purpose of these studies is to identify, as of the date of such report, potential areas of environmental concern related to past and present activities or from nearby operations. The scope and extent of each investigation is dependent upon the size and complexity of the property and/or operation and on recommendations by independent environmental consultants.
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by evolving customer needs and rapid technological change. We compete with a number of other manufacturers, some of which have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. In addition, these competitors may have the ability to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies, adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements, have stronger customer relationships, have greater name recognition and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully against designers and manufacturers of specialized electronic systems and components or within the markets for security and inspection systems, patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, or optoelectronic devices. Future competitive pressures may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In the security and inspection market, competition is based primarily on factors such as product performance, functionality and quality, government regulatory approvals and qualifications, the overall cost effectiveness of the system, prior customer relationships, technological capabilities of the products, price, local market presence, program execution capability, and breadth of sales and service organization. Competition results in price reductions and reduced margins and could result in loss of market share. Although our competitors offer products in competition with one or more of our products, we can supply a variety of system types and offer among the widest array of solutions available from a single supplier. This variety of technologies also permits us to offer unique hybrid systems to our customers that utilize two or more of these technologies, thereby optimizing flexibility, performance and cost to meet the customer&#8217;s unique application requirements.
In the markets in which we compete to provide optoelectronic devices and electronics manufacturing services, competition is based primarily on factors such as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices, product quality, timeliness of delivery, price, technical support and the ability to provide fully integrated services from application development and design through production. Because we specialize in custom subsystems requiring a high degree of engineering expertise, we believe that we generally do not compete to any significant degree with any other large United States, European or Asian manufacturers of standard optoelectronic components. Competition in the extensive electronic manufacturing services market ranges from multinational corporations with sales in excess of several billion dollars, to large regional competitors and to small local assembly companies. In our experience, the OEM customers to whom we provide such services prefer to engage companies that offer both local and lower-cost off-shore facilities. Along with a number of domestic competitors for these services, our high-volume, low-cost contract manufacturing locations in Southeast Asia compete with other manufacturers in the same region.
We currently measure our backlog as quantifiable purchase orders or contracts that have been signed, for which revenues are expected to be recognized within the next five years. In instances where we are not able to estimate the value of a purchase order or contract, they are not included in backlog.
We ship most of our baggage and parcel inspection, people screening, patient monitoring and cardiology and remote monitoring systems and optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems within one to several months after receiving an order. However, such shipments may be delayed for a variety of reasons, including supply chain disruptions and any special design or requirements of the customer. In addition, large orders of security and inspection products typically require greater lead-times. Fulfillment of orders of our Rapiscan RTT hold (checked) baggage screening equipment generally requires longer lead times. Further, we provide turnkey screening services to certain customers for which we may recognize revenue over multi-year periods.
Certain of our cargo and vehicle inspection systems may require more than a year of lead-time. We have experienced some significant shipping delays associated with our cargo and vehicle inspection systems. Such delays can occur for many reasons, including: (i) additional time necessary to coordinate and conduct factory inspections with the customer before shipment; (ii) a customer&#8217;s need to engage in time-consuming site construction to accommodate the system, over which we have no control or responsibility; (iii) additional fine tuning of such systems once they are installed; (iv) design or specification changes by the customer; (v) time needed to obtain export licenses and/or letters of credit; and (vi) delays originating from other contractors on the project. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges and may continue to do so until supply chain delays and international travel restrictions and other protective measures subside.
As of June 30, 2022, our consolidated backlog totaled $1,232 million, compared to $1,076 million as of June 30, 2021. Approximately $514 million of our backlog as of June 30, 2022 is not reasonably expected to be fulfilled in fiscal year 2023. Sales orders underlying our backlog are firm orders; although, from time to time we may agree to permit a customer to cancel an order, or an order may be cancelled for other reasons. Variations in the size of orders, product mix, or delivery requirements, among other factors, may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period. Backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period and should not be considered a meaningful indicator of our performance on an annual or quarterly basis.
We support our employees&#8217; financial, health, and social well-being through competitive compensation structures, including a robust employee stock purchase program and retirement benefits, as well as innovative health and well-being programs focused on promoting the physical and mental health of our workforce. In addition, in response to COVID-19, we implemented changes to protect our employees and to support health and safety protocols. We also strive to create opportunities for career development and growth. We provide training and development programs to foster connections, leadership competency, and team and individual development, and we have a tuition reimbursement program to encourage ongoing education.
Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacturing, sale and service of security and inspection systems as well as in the provision of training to our customers in the use and operation of such systems. Our customers use our security and inspection systems to help them detect items that could be used in performing terrorist acts or other crimes. Some of our security and inspection systems require that an operator interpret an image of suspicious items within a bag, parcel, container, vehicle or other vessel. Others signal to the operator that further investigation is required. In either case, the training, reliability and competence of the customer&#8217;s operator are crucial to the detection of suspicious items.
Security inspection systems that signal to the operator that further investigation is required are sometimes referred to in the security industry as &#8220;automatic&#8221; detection systems. Nevertheless, if such a system were to fail to signal to an operator when an explosive or other contraband was in fact present, resulting in significant damage, we would be subject to risk of significant product liability claims. Security inspection by technological means is circumstance and application-specific. Our security and inspection systems offer significant capabilities, but also have performance limitations and cannot be designed to work under all circumstances. They can also malfunction, including if not properly maintained.
We also offer turnkey security screening solutions under which we perform certain of the security screening tasks that have historically been performed by our customers. Such projects expose us to certain professional liability risks that are inherent in performing security inspection services for the purpose of detecting contraband items, including items that could be used in performing terrorist acts or other crimes. If a contraband item were to pass through our operations and be used to perform a terrorist act or other crime, we would be subject to risk of significant professional liability claims.
In addition, there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims should an act of terrorism occur. Past terrorism attacks in the U.S. and in other locations worldwide and the potential for future attacks have caused commercial insurance for such threats to become extremely difficult to obtain. In the event that we are found liable following an act of terrorism, the insurance we currently have in place would not fully cover the claims for damages. Further, if our security and inspection systems fail to, or are perceived to have failed to, help detect a threat, we could experience negative publicity and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
The loss of certain of our customers, including government agencies that can modify or terminate agreements more easily than other commercial customers with which we contract, the failure to continue to diversify our customer base or the non-renewal of certain material contracts could have a negative effect on our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our acquisition and alliance activities could result in disruption of our ongoing business and other operational difficulties, unrecoverable costs, and other negative consequences, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
potential liabilities of, or claims against, an acquired company, some of which might not be known until after the acquisition;
difficulty in managing product co-development activities with our alliance partners;
unanticipated changes in market or industry practices that adversely impact our strategic and financial expectations regarding an acquired company or acquired assets and require us to write off or dispose of such acquired company or assets;
Integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be complex, time consuming and expensive, and can negatively impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The use of debt to fund acquisitions or for other related purposes increases our interest expense and leverage. If we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current stockholders&#160;percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted. As a result of these and other risks, we cannot be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct, operating results or financial condition of our business.
Substantial declines in crude oil prices or extended periods of low crude oil prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Some of our international customers have procurement budgets that are strongly correlated with fluctuations in the price of crude oil. Historically, the market for crude oil has been volatile and unpredictable. Crude oil prices are subject to rapid and significant fluctuations in response to global events and relatively minor changes in supply and demand. While factors relating the price of crude oil to demand for our products and services are complex, a period of depressed crude oil prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results. 
U.S. budgeting process disruptions could reduce government spending, which could adversely impact our revenues, earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
Funding for U.S. federal Government activities takes place on an annual basis with the Government fiscal year beginning on October 1 and ending on September 30. In recent years, the budgeting process has often not been completed by October 1st, which has required temporary extensions of funding authority, known as a continuing resolution. Because the provision of appropriated funds is undertaken on an annual basis and subject to budgetary rules and requirements, there can be disruptions to federal funding of current and future procurements.
We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in each of our divisions. In the security and inspection and patient monitoring and cardiology systems markets, competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance, functionality and quality, prior customer relationships, technological capabilities of the product, price, certification by government authorities, past performance, local market presence and breadth of sales and service organization. In the optoelectronic devices and electronics manufacturing markets, competition is based primarily on factors such as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices, product quality, timeliness of delivery, price, customer technical support and on the ability to provide fully-integrated services from application development and design through volume subsystem production. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of our competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner. We anticipate that we may have to downward adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors may emerge and entire product lines or service offerings may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines or service offerings. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Healthcare cost containment pressures and legislative or regulatory reforms may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Third-party payers globally are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs which can limit the amount that healthcare providers may be willing to pay for medical devices. In the United States, hospital and other healthcare provider customers that purchase our products typically bill various third-party payers to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the procedures or tests in which our products are used and bill patients for any deductibles or co-payments. Because there is often no separate reimbursement for our products, any decline in the amount payers are willing to reimburse our customers for the procedures and tests associated with our products could make it difficult for customers to continue using, or adopt, our products and create additional pricing pressure for us. 
There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, and some could significantly affect the ways in which doctors, hospitals, healthcare systems and health insurance companies are compensated for the services they provide, which could have a material impact on our business. It is not clear at this time what changes may impact the ability of hospitals and hospital networks to purchase the patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, and connected care systems that we sell or if it will alter market-based incentives that hospitals and hospital networks currently face to continually improve, upgrade and expand their use of such equipment.
Efforts by governmental and third-party payers to reduce healthcare costs or the implementation of new legislative reforms imposing additional government controls could cause a reduction in sales or in the selling price of our products, which could adversely affect our business,
Consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
The healthcare industry has been consolidating and organizations such as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts, such as the United States Veterans Administration, continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our healthcare provider customers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts. The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing. If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants. Even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of products. Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins, business, financial condition and results of operations. We expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Technological advances and evolving industry and regulatory standards and certifications could reduce our future product sales, which could cause our revenues to grow more slowly or decline.
The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing customer needs, evolving industry or regulatory standards and certifications and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The emergence of new industry or regulatory standards and certification requirements in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our products. This could happen, for example, if new standards and technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our applications. In addition, any products or processes that we develop may become obsolete or uneconomical before we recover all or any of the expenses incurred in connection with their development. We cannot provide assurance that we will succeed in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change, new industry standards, changed customer requirements or competitive products on a timely and cost-effective basis. Additionally, even if we are able to develop new products and product enhancements, we cannot provide assurance that they will be profitable or that they will achieve market acceptance.
We develop certain of our security inspection technologies to meet the certification requirements of various agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration and the European Civil Aviation Conference among others. Such standards are occasionally subject to change as threat and risk assessments evolve, and we may not ultimately be able to develop technologies, or develop in a timely way, solutions that are ultimately able to meet the new standards.
Certain of our U.S. Government contracts are dependent upon our employees obtaining and maintaining required security clearances, as well as our ability to obtain security clearances for the facilities in which we perform sensitive government work.
Certain of our U.S. Government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances, and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances. If we cannot maintain or obtain the required security clearances for our facilities and our employees, or obtain these clearances in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform certain U.S. Government contracts. Further, loss of a facility clearance, or an employee&#8217;s failure to obtain or maintain a security clearance, could result in a U.S. Government customer terminating an existing contract or choosing not to renew a contract. Lack of required clearances could also impede our ability to bid on or win new U.S. Government contracts. This could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and political conditions or otherwise. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or adoption of new tax legislation or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.
We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. As a result, the U.S. and certain other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia and could impose further sanctions that could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict or the sanctions imposed to date, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. Such geopolitical instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to sell to, ship products to, collect payments from, and support customers in certain regions based on trade restrictions, embargoes and export control law restrictions, and logistics restrictions including closures of air space, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from supply chain and logistics challenges.
As a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, there is also an increased likelihood of cyberattacks or cybersecurity incidents that could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. Any attempts by cyber attackers to disrupt our information systems or the information systems of our vendors, if successful, could harm our business, result in the misappropriation of funds, be expensive to remedy, and damage our reputation or brand. Insurance may not be sufficient to cover significant expenses and losses related to such cyberattacks and cybersecurity incidents.
As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to extensive Federal procurement rules&#160;and regulations as well as contractual obligations that are unique to doing business with the U.S. Government. Non-compliance with any such rules, regulations or contractual obligations could negatively affect current programs, potential awards and our ability to do business with the U.S. Government in the future.
U.S. Government contractors must comply with extensive procurement regulations and other requirements including, but not limited to, those appearing in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and its supplements, as well as specific procurement rules and contractual conditions imposed by various U.S. Government agencies. In addition, U.S. Government contracts typically contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide Government agencies rights not typically found in commercial contracts, including the ability to: (i) terminate, reduce the value of, or otherwise modify existing contracts; (ii) suspend or prohibit us from doing business with the Government or a specific Government agency; and (iii) claim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us at the Government&#8217;s expense.
U.S. Government agencies and the agencies of many other governments with which we contract can terminate their contracts with us for convenience, and in that event, we generally may recover only our incurred costs and expenses on the work completed prior to termination. If an agency terminates a contract with us for default, we may be denied any recovery and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the agency in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source. Decisions by an agency to terminate one of our contracts for default could negatively affect our ability to win future awards not only from such agency, but also from other government agencies and commercial customers, many of whom evaluate past performance, or are required to review past performance information, when making their procurement decisions.
U.S. Government agencies may also initiate civil False Claims Act litigation against us based on allegations related to our performance of contracts for the U.S. Government, or to our compliance with procurement regulations and other legal requirements to which such contracts are subject, or both. Such litigation can be expensive to defend and if found liable can result in treble damages and significant civil penalties. The U.S. Government may also initiate administrative proceedings that, if resulting in an adverse finding against us or any of our subsidiaries as to our present responsibility to be a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, could result in our company or our subsidiaries being suspended for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export privileges and, if satisfying the requisite level of seriousness, in our debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government for a specified term as well as being subject to other remedies available to the U.S. Government.
The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our revenues are dependent on orders of security and inspection systems, turnkey security screening solutions and patient monitoring and cardiology and remote monitoring systems, which may have lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles.
Sales of security and inspection systems and turnkey security screening solutions often depend upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand existing airports, border crossing inspection sites, seaport inspection sites, military facilities and other security installations. In the case of turnkey security screening solutions, the commencement of screening operations may be dependent on the approval, by a government agency, of the protocols and procedures that our personnel are to follow during the performance of their activities. In addition, turnkey screening solutions projects, in contrast to the sale and installation of security inspection equipment, also require that we hire and manage large numbers of local personnel in jurisdictions where we may not have previously operated. Sales outside of the United States of our patient monitoring and cardiology and remote monitoring systems depend in significant part on the decision of governmental agencies to build new medical facilities or to expand or update existing medical facilities. Accordingly, a significant portion of our sales of security and inspection systems, turnkey security screening solutions and our patient monitoring and cardiology and remote monitoring systems is often subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes. During these approval periods, we expend significant financial and management resources in anticipation of future revenues that may not occur. If we fail to receive such revenues after expending such resources, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards and customer needs. Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to: (i) accurately anticipate customer needs; (ii) innovate and develop new technologies and applications; (iii) successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; (iv) price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time; and (v) differentiate our offerings from our competitors&#8217; offerings. Some of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers&#8217; products. In developing any new product, we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers&#8217; needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues.
Interruptions in our ability to purchase raw materials and subcomponents may adversely affect our profitability.
We purchase raw materials and certain subcomponents from third parties. We generally do not have guaranteed long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers. In addition, for certain raw materials and subcomponents that we use, there are a limited number of potential suppliers that we have qualified or that we are currently able to qualify. Consequently, some of the key raw materials and subcomponents that we use are currently available to us only from a single vendor. The reliance on a single qualified vendor could result in delays in delivering products or increases in the cost of manufacturing the affected products. Any material interruption in our ability to purchase necessary raw materials or subcomponents or a significant increase in price of raw materials or subcomponents could adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and therefore could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We contract with third-parties that may be unable to fulfill contracts on time.
We contract with third-party vendors to service our equipment in the field. We have made such arrangements because sometimes it is more efficient to outsource these activities than it is for our own employees to service our equipment. In addition, some of these vendors maintain stocks of spare parts that are more efficiently accessed in conjunction with a service agreement than would be the case if we were to maintain such spare parts independently. Any material interruption in the ability of our vendors to fulfill such service contracts could adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and therefore could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, purchasers of our security and inspection systems and turnkey security screening solutions sometimes require the construction of the facilities that will house our systems and/or operations. We engage qualified construction firms to perform this work. However, if such firms experience delays, if they perform sub-standard work or if we fail to properly monitor the quality of their work or the timeliness of their progress, we may not be able to complete our construction projects on time. In any such circumstance, we could face the imposition of delay penalties and breach of contract claims by our customer. Any material delay caused by our construction firm subcontractors could therefore ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Economic, political, legal, operational and other risks associated with international sales
 and operations could adversely affect our financial performance.
political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict;
imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions, trade disputes, and other trade restrictions;
compliance with export control and anti-corruption legislation, including but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
Our operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural disasters, epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, terrorist acts and other events beyond our control, which could adversely impact our operations.
Although we perform manufacturing in multiple locations, we generally do not have redundant manufacturing capabilities in place for any particular product or component. As a result, we depend on our current facilities for the continued operation of our business. A natural disaster, epidemic or pandemic, terrorist act, act of war, civil unrest, or other natural or manmade disaster affecting any of our facilities could significantly disrupt our operations, or delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to repair, rebuild, or replace our manufacturing facilities. This delay could be lengthy and we could incur significant expenses to repair or replace the facilities. Any similar natural or manmade disaster that affects a key supplier or customer could lead to a similar disruption in our business. 
In addition, the ability of our employees and employees of our suppliers and customers to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19, or as a result of the control measures noted above, which may significantly hamper our production throughout the supply chain and constrict sales channels. Our customers may be directly impacted by business curtailments or weak market conditions and may not be willing or able to fulfill their contractual obligations or open letters of credit and may seek to modify or terminate their contracts with us. We may also experience delays in obtaining letters of credit or processing letter of credit payments due to the impacts of COVID-19 on foreign issuing and U.S. intermediary banks. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may create an increased risk of customer defaults or delays in payments. Our customers may terminate or amend their agreements for the purchase or service of our products due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures, or other reasons.
The global supply chain has also been disrupted. Staffing or personnel shortages due to pandemic-related shelter-in-place orders and quarantines have impacted and may continue to impact us and our suppliers. There have been widespread shortages in certain product categories. If the supply chain for materials used in our production process continues to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 or otherwise, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
Any recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products that leads to corrective actions, could have a material adverse impact on us.
Although we believe that existing data continue to support the efficacy and safety of our patient monitoring, cardiology, and connected care products, in the future, longer term study outcomes could demonstrate conflicting clinical effectiveness, a reduction of effectiveness, no clinical effectiveness or longer-term safety issues. This type of differing data could have a detrimental effect on the market penetration and usage of our medical device products. As a result, our sales may decline or expected growth would be negatively impacted. This could negatively impact our operating condition and financial results.
More generally, all medical devices can experience performance problems that require review and possible corrective action by us or a component supplier. We cannot provide assurance that component failures, manufacturing errors, noncompliance with quality system requirements or good manufacturing practices, design defects, software defects, and/or labeling inadequacies in any device that could result in an unsafe condition or injury to the patient will not occur. The FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or if a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers may also, under their own initiative, stop shipment or recall a product if any material deficiency is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, noncompliance with good manufacturing practices or quality system requirements, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Similar regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall products because of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could endanger health. A recall involving our products could be particularly harmful to our business, financial and operating results. In addition, under the FDA&#8217;s medical device reporting regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA or a foreign governmental authority could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.
Depending on the corrective action we take to redress a product&#8217;s deficiencies or defects, the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, civil penalties or criminal fines. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our sales as well as face material adverse publicity or regulatory consequences, which could harm our business, including our ability to market our products in the future.
Any adverse event involving our products, whether in the United States or abroad, could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection, mandatory recall, orders of repair, replacement or refund or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital and may harm our reputation and financial results.
We rely on third parties and our own systems for interaction with our customers and suppliers and employees, and a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or any other failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business.
We rely extensively on our information technology systems and systems and services provided by third parties to interact with our employees and our customers and suppliers. These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, transmitting data used by our service personnel and by and among our wide-spread personnel and facilities, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage our business. We do not control our third-party service providers and we do not maintain redundant systems for some of such services, increasing our vulnerability to problems with such services. If the systems on which we rely are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from failures of our third-party service providers to catastrophic events, to power outages, to security breaches, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.
We could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm, and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyber-attacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers, suppliers, or other third parties.
We manage and store proprietary, sensitive and confidential data related to our business operations. We may be subject to cyber-attacks and breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Hackers may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware, ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our systems and/or products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacturing, including &#8220;bugs&#8221; and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our systems or products. Cyber-threats vary in technique, are persistent, frequently change, and increasingly are more sophisticated, targeted, and difficult to detect or prevent.
We expend significant capital and resources to protect against the threat of security breaches, including cyber-attacks, viruses, worms, malware, ransomware and other malicious software programs. Substantial additional expenditures may be required before or after a cyber-attack to mitigate or alleviate problems caused by the unauthorized access, theft of data stored within our information systems, or the introduction of computer malware or ransomware to our environment. Our remediation efforts may not be successful, and there could be interruptions, delays, or cessation of service due to cyber-attachs or other data security breaches.
We often identify attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems. Given the rapidly evolving nature and proliferation of cyber threats, there can be no assurance that our employee training, operational, and other technical security measures or other controls will detect, prevent or remediate security or data breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access, damage, or interruption of our systems and operations. We are likely to face attempted cyber-attacks in the future. Accordingly, we may be vulnerable to losses associated with the improper functioning, security breach, or unavailability of our information systems as well as any systems used in acquired operations.
In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved use or disclosure of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our suppliers, customers or other third parties could expose us or any such affected third party to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business, even if we were not responsible for the breach. Furthermore, we are exposed to additional risks because we rely in certain capacities on third-party software, data management, and cloud service providers with possible security problems and security vulnerabilities beyond our control. Media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our third-party suppliers, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business.
Given increasing cyber security threats, there can be no assurance that we will not experience business interruptions, data loss, ransom, misappropriation, or corruption or theft or misuse of proprietary information or related litigation and investigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and harm our business reputation.
Our inability to successfully manage the implementation of a company-wide enterprise resource planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) system could adversely affect our operating results.
Our credit facility contains provisions that could restrict our ability to finance our future operations or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.
These covenants could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, finance our operations, engage in strategic acquisitions or disposals or meet our capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios. Our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. If we are not able to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms, our ability to finance our operations, engage in strategic acquisitions, and otherwise meet our capital needs would be significantly impaired.
The SAFETY Act provides important legal liability protections for providers of qualified anti-terrorism products and services. Under the SAFETY Act, providers, such as our Security division, may apply to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for coverage of their products and services. If granted coverage, such providers receive certain legal protections against product liability, professional liability and certain other claims that could arise following an act of terrorism. We have applied to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for many of the products and services offered by our Security division, but we do not enjoy coverage under the SAFETY Act (or the highest level of coverage) for every product line, model number and service offering that our Security division provides. In addition, the terms of the SAFETY Act coverage decisions awarded to us by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security restrict coverage to specific models numbers and options within our product lines, impose other limitations, and contain conditions and requirements that we may not (or may not be able to) continue to satisfy in the future. Delays by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in granting coverage (or extensions of coverage) and in our ability to meet the evolving standards of the SAFETY Act application process has and may in the future continue to result in coverage limitations for our products and services.
The development, manufacturing and sale of medical devices expose us to significant risk of product liability claims, product recalls and, sometimes, product failure claims. We face an inherent business risk of financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our medical devices results in personal injury or death. Substantial product liability litigation currently exists within the medical device industry. Some of our patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, and connected care products may become subject to product liability claims and/or product recalls. Future product liability claims and/or product recall costs may exceed the limits of our insurance coverages, or such insurance may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, a significant product liability claim or product recall could significantly damage our reputation for producing safe, reliable and effective products, making it more difficult for us to market and sell our products in the future. Consequently, a product liability claim, product recall or other claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. It also requires us to maintain specific record-keeping standards and adequate internal accounting controls. In addition, we are subject to similar requirements in other countries. Bribery, corruption, and trade laws and regulations, and the enforcement thereof, are increasing in frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. Although we have internal policies and procedures with the intention of assuring compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, distributors, resellers and contractors involved in our international sales may take actions in violations of such policies. If our internal controls and compliance program do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, distributors, resellers, contractors and/or other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-bribery, anti-corruption or similar laws and regulations, we may incur severe fines, penalties and reputational damage.
We are subject to import and export controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.
Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. export control and customs regulations and customs regulations of other countries. These regulations are complex and vary among the legal jurisdictions in which we operate. Any alleged or actual failure to comply with such regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation, and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. Depending on severity, any of these penalties could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection. If we fail to meet our compliance obligations under applicable privacy and data protection regulations, even if such compliance by us is inadvertent, or if we are unable to comply with changes to such requirements, we might be subject to fines, legal disputes, or other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, there are other federal laws that include specific privacy and security obligations, above and beyond HIPAA, for certain types of health information and impose additional sanctions and penalties. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted legislation requiring notice to individuals of security breaches involving protected health information, which is not uniformly defined among the breach notification laws. Organizations must review each state&#8217;s definitions, mandates, and notification requirements and timelines to appropriately prepare and notify affected individuals and government agencies, including the attorney general, in compliance with such state laws. Further, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area. These state laws may be more stringent than HIPAA requirements. California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act, which imposes significant changes in data privacy regulation, and New York has passed the Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security Act, which expands the state&#8217;s existing privacy laws. GDPR, a regulation implemented on May 25, 2018 in the EU on data protection and privacy for all individuals in the EU and the EEA, applies to all enterprises, regardless of location, that are doing business in the EU or that collect and analyze data tied to EU and EEA residents. GDPR creates a range of compliance obligations, including stringent technical and security controls surrounding the storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, and significantly increases financial penalties for noncompliance.
We are facing an increasingly complex international regulatory environment which is constantly changing and if we fail to comply with international regulatory requirements, or are unable to comply with changes to such requirements, our financial performance may be harmed.
Our international operations and sales subject us to an international regulatory environment which is becoming increasingly complex and is constantly changing due to factors beyond our control. Risks associated with our international operations and sales include, without limitation, those arising from the following factors:
If we fail to comply with applicable international regulatory requirements, even if such non-compliance by us is inadvertent, or if we are unable to comply with changes to such requirements, our financial performance may be harmed.
Substantial government regulation in the United States and abroad may restrict our ability to sell our patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, and connected care systems, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business.
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries extensively and rigorously regulate our patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, and connected care systems, including the research and development, design, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, clearance or approval, safety and efficacy, labeling, advertising, promotion, pricing, recordkeeping, reporting, import and export, post-approval studies and sale and distribution of these products. In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we must first receive clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as discussed under Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Business - Regulation of Medical Devices.&#8221; Some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k). The FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons.
Our future products may not obtain FDA clearance on a timely basis, or at all. Further, the FDA makes periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers and in connection with such inspections issues observations when the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations. If FDA observations are not addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA may issue a warning letter and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action, which could include the shutdown of our production facilities, adverse publicity, and civil and criminal penalties. The expense and costs of any corrective actions that we may take, which may include product recalls, correction and removal of products from customer sites and/or changes to our product manufacturing and quality systems, could adversely impact our financial results. Issuance of a warning letter may also lead customers to delay purchasing decisions or cancel orders.
Our patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, and connected care systems must also comply with the laws and regulations of foreign countries in which we develop, manufacture and market such products. In general, the extent and complexity of medical device regulation is increasing worldwide. This trend is likely to continue, and the cost and time required to obtain marketing clearance in any given country may increase as a result. Our products may not obtain any necessary foreign clearances on a timely basis, or at all.
Legislative or regulatory reforms such as the new EU Medical Devices Regulation may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain certification, regulatory clearance, or approval of any future products and to manufacture, market, and distribute our products after certification, clearance, or approval is obtained.
Following its entry into application on May 26, 2021, the new EU Medical Devices Regulation (MDR), which replaced the EU Medical Devices Directive, introduced substantial changes to the obligations with which medical device manufacturers must comply in the EEA. High risk medical devices are subject to additional scrutiny during the conformity assessment procedure. Unlike directives such as the EU Medical Devices Directive, which must be implemented into the national laws of EEA countries, the EU MDR is directly applicable, without the need for adoption by EEA country laws implementing them, in all EEA countries and intended to eliminate current differences in regulation of medical devices among EEA countries. The EU MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices to ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. 
The MDR imposes a number of new requirements on manufacturers of medical devices and imposes increased compliance obligations for us to access the EEA market. Our failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, including those administered by authorities of the EEA countries, could result in enforcement actions against us and impair our ability to market products in the EEA in the future. Any changes to the membership of the EU, such as the recent departure of the United Kingdom under Brexit, may impact the regulatory requirements for impacted countries and impair our business operations and our ability to market products in such countries. For further discussion of the MDR, see Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Business - Regulation of Medical Devices.&#8221;
We may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions, or other enforcement actions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses, resulting in damage to our reputation and business.
Our promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of a medical device for a use that has not been cleared or approved by the FDA known as &#8220;off-label&#8221; use. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of warning letters, untitled letters, fines, penalties, consent decrees, injunctions, or seizures, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation and financial results. We could also be subject to enforcement action under other federal or state laws, including the False Claims Act.
Our failure to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations relating to our healthcare business could have an adverse effect on our business.
Although we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers for our products, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal and state governments. Healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws potentially applicable to our operations are discussed in Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Business &#8211; Regulation of Medical Devices.&#8221;
The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased because many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal health care fraud statutes; a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action against us for violation of these laws could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#8217;s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental health care programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could impair our ability to operate our business, financial condition and our financial results.
Significant inflation and increasing interest rates could adversely affect our business and financial results.
The current inflation rate could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs, including our materials, freight, and labor costs, which are already under pressure due to supply chain constraints and the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a highly inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the sales prices of our products to match the rate of inflation or our increasing operating costs, which could reduce our profit margins and have an adverse effect on our financial performance. Further, pressures from inflation could negatively impact the willingness and ability of our customers to purchase our products in the same volumes as have been purchased in the past or are currently being purchased.
As interest rates rise to address inflation or otherwise, such increases will impact the base rates applicable in our credit arrangements and will result in borrowed funds becoming more expensive to us over time. These financing pressures also can have a negative impact on customers&#8217; willingness to purchase our products in the same volumes as previously purchased. 
We maintain insurance for certain risks, and we believe our insurance coverage is consistent with general practices within our industry. However, the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. Consistent with market conditions in the insurance industry, premiums and deductibles for some of our insurance policies have been increasing and may continue to increase in the future. In some instances, some types of insurance may become available only for reduced amounts of coverage, if at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that our insurers would not challenge coverage for certain claims. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured or that our insurers disputed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
We are involved in various litigation matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.
Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management&#8217;s attention away from the running of our business. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class actions, or by governmental entities in investigations and proceedings. If we are unsuccessful in our defense in litigation matters, or any other legal proceeding, we may be forced to pay damages or fines, some of which may be in excess of our insurance coverage, and/or change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information about our litigation matters, see &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

In April 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock and increased the authorization in August 2020 to 3,000,000 shares. &#160;Upon repurchase, the shares are restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares, and we record them as a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding in our consolidated financial statements.
The graph assumes that $100.00 was invested on June&#160;30, 2017 in (a)&#160;our Common Stock, (b)&#160;The Nasdaq Composite Index, and (c)&#160;the companies comprising the peer group described above (weighted according to the issuer&#8217;s stock market capitalization at the beginning of each period for which a return is indicated). The graph assumes that all dividends were reinvested. Historical stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.
We are a vertically integrated designer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems and components for critical applications. We sell our products and provide related services in diversified markets, including homeland security, healthcare, defense and aerospace. We have three operating divisions, each of which is a reportable segment: (a) Security, providing security and inspection systems and turnkey security screening solutions; (b) Healthcare, providing patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, and connected care systems and associated accessories; and (c) Optoelectronics and Manufacturing, providing specialized electronic components and electronic manufacturing services for our Security and Healthcare divisions, as well as to third parties for applications in the defense and aerospace markets, among others.
Through our Security division, we provide security screening products and services globally, as well as turnkey security screening solutions. These products and services are used to inspect baggage, parcels, cargo, people, vehicles and other objects for weapons, explosives, drugs, radioactive and nuclear materials and other contraband. Revenues from our Security division accounted for 56% of our total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2022.
Currently, the U.S. federal government is discussing various options to address the U.S. federal government&#8217;s overall fiscal challenges and we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts. While we believe that national security spending will continue to be a priority, U.S. government budget deficits and the national debt have created increasing pressure to examine and reduce spending across many federal agencies. Additionally, there continues to be volatility in international markets that has impacted international security spending. We believe that the diversified product portfolio and international customer mix of our Security division position us well to withstand the impact of these uncertainties and even benefit from specific initiatives within various governments. However, depending on how future budgetary reductions may be implemented and how the U.S. federal government and our other international customers manage their fiscal challenges, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that these actions could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Through our Healthcare division, we design, manufacture, market and service patient monitoring, cardiology and remote monitoring, and connected care systems globally for sale primarily to hospitals and medical centers. Our products monitor patients in critical, emergency and perioperative care areas of the hospital and provide information, through wired and wireless networks, to physicians and nurses who may be at the patient&#8217;s bedside, in another area of the hospital or even outside the hospital. Revenues from our Healthcare division accounted for 17% of our total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2022.
The healthcare markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We believe that our customers choose among competing products on the basis of product performance, functionality, value and service. Although there has been an increase in demand for patient monitoring products due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is continued uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal government budget and the Affordable Care Act, either of which may impact hospital spending, third-party payer reimbursement and fees to be levied on certain medical device revenues, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, hospital capital spending appears to have been impacted by strategic uncertainties surrounding the Affordable Care Act and economic pressures. We also believe that global economic uncertainty has caused some hospitals and healthcare providers to delay purchases of our products and services. During this period of uncertainty, sales of our healthcare products may be negatively impacted. A prolonged delay could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Through our Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division, we design, manufacture and market optoelectronic devices and flex circuits and provide electronics manufacturing services globally for use in a broad range of applications, including aerospace and defense electronics, security and inspection systems, medical imaging and diagnostics, telecommunications, office automation, computer peripherals, industrial automation, and consumer products. We also provide our optoelectronic devices and electronics manufacturing services to OEM customers, and our own Security and Healthcare divisions. Revenues from external customers in our Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division accounted for 27% of our total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2022.
We acquired two small businesses during fiscal 2022 and one small business during fiscal 2021 as described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, none of which were considered material.
The following is a discussion of certain trends and uncertainties that we believe have influenced, and may continue to influence, our results of operations.
 The coronavirus disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic, including the emergence of new variants, has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment, with millions of confirmed cases, business slowdowns and shutdowns, and market volatility. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, significant economic disruptions and has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our operations and the operations of our suppliers, logistics providers and customers as a result of supply chain disruptions and delays, as well as labor challenges associated with employee absences, travel restrictions, site access, quarantine restrictions, remote work, and adjusted work schedules. Our ability to continue to operate without significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain and to keep our manufacturing facilities open and operating effectively. We have endeavored to implement government and health authority recommendations to protect our employees worldwide including with respect to vaccine administration. There is substantial uncertainty regarding the duration, scope, and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the early stages of the pandemic and continuing to a lesser extent throughout the duration of the pandemic, our Healthcare division experienced increased demand for certain products as a result of COVID-19. In our Security division, throughout the pandemic, receipt of certain orders has been delayed, most notably with respect to our aviation and cargo products, and our revenues have been adversely impacted as a result of the pandemic. As many customers of our Security division continue to be impacted by the pandemic, we have received and could receive further requests to delay deliveries of equipment and modify service arrangements or the scheduling of factory or site acceptance tests, which has impacted, and could further impact, timing of revenue recognition. In addition, as a result of COVID-19 related government regulations, certain of our global manufacturing facilities have had to limit operations and might have to limit operations in the future. While we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to materials shortages, longer lead times on deliveries and transportation constraints. If these business interruptions resulting from COVID-19 were to be prolonged or expanded in scope, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely impacted. We intend to continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in our best interests and the best interests of our employees, suppliers and customers. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance in future periods, including our ability to execute our programs in the expected timeframe, remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic-related developments, including the duration of the pandemic, potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection or potential new variants, the effectiveness and adoption of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, supplier impacts and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread, including the implementation of any federal, state, local or foreign vaccine mandates, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on government budgets and other funding priorities, including international priorities, that impact demand for our products and services are also difficult to predict, but could negatively affect our future results and performance.
Our products and services are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with a large percentage of our sales generated outside the United States. Therefore, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. There is uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic factors in the U.S. and globally characterized by the supply chain environment, inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, and labor shortages. Further, global economic conditions continue to be highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, these other global macroeconomic factors, coupled with the U.S. political climate and political unrest internationally, have created uncertainty and impacted demand for certain of our products and services. Also, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the sanctions imposed in response to this conflict have increased global economic and political uncertainty. While the impact of these factors remains uncertain, we will continue to evaluate the extent to which these factors will impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We do not know how long this uncertainty will continue. These factors could have a material negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, the current domestic and international political environment, including in relation to recent and further potential changes by the U.S. and other countries in policies on global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy and global trade. This uncertainty is exacerbated by sanctions imposed by the U.S. government against certain businesses and individuals in select countries. Continued or increased uncertainty regarding global trade due to these or other factors may require us to modify our current business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 As described above, our Healthcare division experienced some increased demand for its patient monitoring products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during the earlier stages of the pandemic that has continued to a lesser extent throughout the duration of the pandemic. Increased healthcare capital purchases made in prior periods may result in fewer capital purchases in subsequent periods. The pandemic may also impact our ability to manufacture product needed to timely fill orders if we experience supply chain disruptions or need to close any manufacturing facility due to employee COVID-19 cases or local government regulations.
 Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in raw material, component, and logistics costs. Our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including freight and shipping activities, have been and may continue to be impacted by increased vendor costs as well as the current global supply chain bottleneck. Specifically, we are impacted by the global shortage of electronic components and other materials needed for production and freight availability. We expect continued disruptions in obtaining material and freight availability as the world economies react to and recover from supply chain shortages. This increased cost environment has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to mitigate the impact of increased costs through pricing or other actions, there could be a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). Our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may differ from such estimates. Our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following summarizes our critical accounting policies and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements:
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We write down inventory for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on historical usage, orders on hand, assessments of future demands, and market conditions, among other items. If these factors are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future&#160;years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely on estimates. To provide insight, we use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts. We believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred income tax assets may expire unused and therefore have established a valuation allowance against them. Although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred income tax assets, we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods. However, deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if our estimates of taxable income are significantly reduced or available tax planning strategies are no longer viable.
Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. More conservative estimates of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
The process of estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards and recognizing stock-based compensation cost over their requisite vesting period involves significant assumptions and judgments. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model which requires that we make certain assumptions regarding: (i)&#160;the expected volatility in the market price of our Common Stock; (ii)&#160;dividend yield; (iii)&#160;risk-free interest rates; and (iv)&#160;the period of time employees are expected to hold the award prior to exercise. We estimate the fair value of restricted stock unit awards on the date of the grant using the market price of our Common Stock on that date. In addition, we estimate the expected impact of forfeited awards and recognize stock-based compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest. If actual forfeiture rates differ materially from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense could differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded in the current period. We periodically review actual forfeiture experience and revise our estimates, as necessary. We recognize the cumulative effect of changes in the estimated forfeiture rate as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the revision. As a result, if we revise our assumptions and estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could change materially in the future. Certain restricted stock units vest based upon the achievement of pre-established performance criteria. We estimate the fair value of performance-based awards at the date of grant based upon the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based awards if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based awards over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. See Note&#160;9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of stock-based compensation.
We are subject to various claims and legal proceedings. We review the status of each significant legal dispute to which we are a party and assess our potential financial exposure, if any. If the potential financial exposure from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and revise our estimates accordingly. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
 Gross profit is impacted by sales volume, productivity, and changes in overall manufacturing-related costs, such as raw materials and component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, and logistics. Gross profit increased approximately $5 million as compared to the prior year on a 3% increase in sales. &#160;The gross margin declined from 36.6% to 35.9% driven by the mix of sales and increased costs. Our cost of goods sold increased year-over-year primarily as a result of the increase in revenues and higher raw material and freight costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 decreased on a year-over-year basis due to (i) strong sales growth within our Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division (which has the lowest gross margin among our divisions), (ii) a reduction in revenues in our Healthcare division (which has the highest gross margin among our divisions), and (iii) a reduction in the Security division gross margin due to increased component and freight costs, a less favorable sales mix and a reduced service gross margin.
Our significant selling, general and administrative (&#8220;SG&amp;A&#8221;) expenses include employee compensation, sales commissions, travel, professional services, marketing expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense. 
 SG&amp;A expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 was lower than such expense in the same prior-year period due to reduced provision for losses on accounts receivable and certain bad debt recoveries totaling $16 million as well as a decrease of approximately $3 million for professional fees and other miscellaneous reductions of approximately $4 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in employee compensation expense of $11 million, increased travel and entertainment of $4 million, and increased marketing expenses of $3 million.
 The increase in R&amp;D expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 from the same prior-year period was primarily due to higher employee compensation expense of $7 million to support new product development initiatives and approximately $1 million in other expenses primarily in our Security and Healthcare divisions. This increase was partially offset by reductions in supplies of approximately $2 million.
Impairment, restructuring and other charges generally consist of charges relating to reductions in our workforce, facilities consolidation, impairment of assets, costs related to acquisition activity, legal charges and other non-recurring charges. We have undertaken certain restructuring activities in an effort to align our global capacity and infrastructure with demand by our customers and fully integrate acquisitions, thereby improving our operational efficiency. Our efforts have helped enhance our ability to improve operating margins, retain and expand existing relationships with customers and attract new business. We may utilize similar measures in the future to realign our operations to further increase our operating efficiencies. The effect of these efforts may materially affect our future operating results.
 During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, impairment, restructuring and other charges were $7.5 million and consisted of $5.1 million for legal charges, net of insurance reimbursements, $1.1 million in charges for employee terminations, $0.3 million in acquisition related costs, and $1.0 million in impairment charges. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we incurred $7.2 million for exit activities associated with an expired turnkey contract in Mexico. Such exit costs include $2.8 million for employee terminations, $1.1 million for facility closure and other exit costs, direct transaction costs of $2.7 million, and $0.6 million for right-of-use asset impairment for a leased facility. We also incurred costs of $2.1 million for other employee terminations and facility closure costs for operational efficiency activities, $0.3 million for acquisition-related activities, and $0.5 million for certain legal charges, net of insurance reimbursements.
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and our credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $64.2 million at June 30, 2022, compared to $80.6 million at June 30, 2021. During fiscal 2022, we generated $63.8 million of cash flow from operations. These proceeds and $64.8 million of net bank borrowings and long-term debt were used for the following: $14.9 million invested in capital expenditures, $14.1 million for the acquisition of two businesses and $131.0 million for share repurchases and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards. If we continue to net settle equity awards, we will use additional cash to pay our tax withholding obligations in connection with such settlements. We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the next 12 months and foreseeable future. In addition, we anticipate that cash generated from operations, without repatriating earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and our credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our obligations in the U.S. 
We have a $750 million credit facility that is comprised of a $600 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $300 million subfacility for letters of credit, and a $150 million delayed draw term loan of which a portion was drawn. The term loan is available for us to draw until September 1, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, there was $60.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $50.0 million outstanding under the term loan, and $78.5 million of outstanding letters of credit. As of June 30, 2022, the total amount available under these credit facilities was $561.5 million. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
 Net cash used in investing activities was $12.7 million during fiscal 2022 as compared to $34.7 million used during the prior year. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by $32 million of proceeds for the sale of corporate owned real estate in a sale leaseback transaction of the Hawthorne Property. During fiscal 2022, we used cash of $14.1 million for the acquisition of businesses as compared to $3.0 million in the prior fiscal year. Net capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 were $14.9 million compared to $16.9 million in the prior year. Expenditures for intangible and other assets in fiscal 2022 were $15.6 million compared to $13.8 million in the prior fiscal year. In addition, purchases of certificates of deposit in fiscal 2022 were $2.2 million compared to $4.9 million in the same prior-year period. 
In April 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 1,000,000 shares, and in August 2020, the Board of Directors increased the maximum number of shares to 3,000,000 shares authorized under the stock repurchase program. This program does not expire unless our Board of Directors acts to terminate the program. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased 1,294,594 shares. As of June 30, 2022, 1,253,401 shares remained available for repurchase.
Importance of International Markets
International markets provide us with significant growth opportunities. Our financial results in future periods could, however, be adversely affected by periodic economic downturns in different regions of the world, changes in trade policies or tariffs, civil or military conflict and other political instability. We monitor economic and currency conditions around the world to evaluate whether there may be any significant effect on our international sales in the future.
Our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including from foreign currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We conduct business in more than 20 countries. We closely monitor our operations in each country in which we do business and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments, and to fluctuations in foreign currencies. Weaknesses in the currencies of some of the countries in which we do business are often offset by strengths in other currencies. Foreign currency financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end rates, except that revenues, costs and expenses are translated at average rates during the reporting period. We include gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions in income, while we exclude those resulting from translation of financial statements from income and include them as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Transaction gains and losses, which were included in our consolidated statement of operations, amounted to a gain (loss) of approximately $(3.4) million, $(1.3) million, and $0.6 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would have resulted in a net increase in our operating income of approximately $14 million in fiscal 2022. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would have resulted in a net decrease in our operating income of approximately $14 million in fiscal 2022.
Heightened levels of inflation continue to present risk for us. We have experienced impacts to our materials and manufacturing costs and labor rates, and suppliers have signaled inflation-related cost pressures, which could flow through to our costs and pricing. If inflation remains at current levels for an extended period, or increases, and we are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our costs could increase, resulting in pressure on our profits and margins. In addition, inflation and the increases in the cost of borrowing from rising interest rates could constrain the overall purchasing power of our customers for our products and services. Rising interest rates also will increase our borrowing costs. We remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the cost competitiveness of our products and services, which may, in part, offset cost increases from inflation.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule&#160;13a-15(f)&#160;or 15d-15(f)&#160;of the Exchange Act) for the Company. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in 
Moss Adams&#160;LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of OSI Systems,&#160;Inc. and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report of Moss Adams&#160;LLP is contained in this annual report.
In designing and evaluating our controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud within the Company have been detected.
A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&#160;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&#160;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&#160;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Testing the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of controls relating to revenue occurrence, including controls over the timing of revenue recognition; and
Performing substantive tests over the timing and occurrence of revenue recognition, which included, among other procedures, reading the executed contract or purchase order to understand the contract, evaluating the contract-specific terms and the reasonableness of the Company&#8217;s judgments about the transfer of control of the performance obligation, and obtaining evidence that the transfer of control had occurred for the revenue recognized.

In addition to these products, we also provide site design, installation, training and technical support services to our customers. We also provide turnkey security screening solutions, which can include the construction, staffing and long-term operation of security screening checkpoints for our customers.
Through our Optoelectronics and Manufacturing segment, we design, manufacture and market optoelectronic devices and flex circuits and provide electronics manufacturing services globally for use in a broad range of applications, including aerospace and defense electronics, X-ray security and inspection systems and medical imaging, chemistry analysis and diagnostics instruments, telecommunications, scanners and industrial automations, internet of things (IoT) and consumer wearable products. This division provides products and services to OEM customers and end users as well as to our Security and Healthcare divisions.
&#8212;The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of OSI Systems,&#160;Inc. and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in joint ventures over which we have significant influence but do not have voting control are accounted for using the equity method. Investments over which we do not have significant influence or control are not material and are carried at cost as there is 
&#8212;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales,costs of sales and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant of these estimates and assumptions for our company relate to contract revenue, fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, values for inventories reported at lower of cost or net realizable value, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, accrued warranty costs, and the recoverability, useful lives and valuation of recorded amounts of long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Changes in estimates are reflected in the periods during which they become known. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, our actual amounts reported in future periods could differ materially from these estimates.
% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. &#160;These foreign funds were held primarily by our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Singapore,
&#8212;We monitor collections and payments from our customers, and we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and other available information. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required.
&#8212;Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We write down inventory for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on historical usage, orders on hand, assessments of future demands, market conditions among other items. If these factors are less favorable than those projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
&#8212;Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are charged while assets are used in service and are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets taking into consideration any estimated salvage value. Amortization of leasehold improvements is calculated on the straight-line method over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. Right-of-use assets from finance leases are included in property and equipment. Amortization of property and equipment under finance leases is included with depreciation expense. &#160;In the event that property and equipment are idle, as a result of excess capacity or the early termination, non-renewal or reduction in scope of a turnkey screening operation, such assets are assessed for impairment on a periodic basis or if any indicators of impairment exist.
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no qualitative factors which would trigger impairment testing between measurement dates. Thus, we have determined that there is 
&#8212;Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, insurance company contracts, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt instruments and foreign currency forward contracts. The carrying values of financial instruments, other than long term debt instruments, are representative of their fair values due to their short-term maturities. The carrying values of our long-term debt instruments are considered to approximate their fair values because the interest rates of these instruments are variable or comparable to current rates for financing available to us. The fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were not significant as of June 30, 2022.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The &#8220;Level&#160;1&#8221; category includes assets and liabilities at quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The &#8220;Level&#160;2&#8221; category includes assets and liabilities from observable inputs other than quoted market prices. The &#8220;Level&#160;3&#8221; category includes assets and liabilities for which valuation techniques are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
 We recognize revenue from sales of products upon shipment or delivery when control of the product transfers to the customer, depending on the terms of each sale, and when collection is probable. In the circumstance where terms of a product sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria, revenue is deferred until we have achieved the customer acceptance criteria unless such acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential. We generally offer customers payment terms of less than one year. In cases when payment terms extend beyond one year, we consider whether the contract has a significant financing component.
 Revenue from services includes installation and implementation of products and turnkey security screening services and after-market services. Generally, revenue from services is recognized over time as the services are performed. Revenues from out of warranty service maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the respective terms of such contracts. Deferred revenue for such services arises from payments received from customers for services not yet performed.
 Sales agreements with customers can be project specific, cover a period of time, and can be renewable periodically. The contracts may contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, installation, services, warranty and other rights. In certain instances, we consider an accepted customer order, governed by a master sales agreement, to be the contract with the customer when legal rights and obligations exist. Contracts with customers may include the sale of products and services, as discussed in the paragraphs above. In certain instances, contracts can contain multiple performance obligations as discussed in the paragraph below. According to the terms of a sale contract, we may receive consideration from a customer prior to transferring goods to the customer, and we record these prepayments as an advance receipt. We also record deferred revenue, typically related to service contacts, when consideration is received before the services have been performed. We recognize contract liabilities and deferred revenue as net sales after all revenue recognition criteria are met.
When determining revenue recognition for contracts, we make judgments based on our understanding of the obligations in each contract. We determine whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential. The determination of whether or not customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognition. Judgments also include estimates of warranty reserves, which are established based on historical experience and knowledge of the product under warranty.
 &#160;Certain agreements with customers include the sale of capital equipment involving multiple elements that may include civil works to prepare a site for the installation of equipment, manufacture and delivery of equipment, installation and integration of equipment, training of customer personnel to operate the equipment and after-market service of the equipment. We generally separate multiple elements in a contract into separate performance obligations if those elements are distinct, both individually and in the context of the contract. If multiple promises comprise a series of distinct services which are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer, they are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation.
The standalone selling price for each performance obligation is an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the good or service. When there is only one performance obligation associated with a contract, the entire sale value is attributed to that obligation. When a contract contains multiple performance obligations, the standalone selling price is first estimated using the observable price, which is generally a list price net of applicable discount, or the price used to sell the good or service in similar circumstances. In circumstances when a selling price is not directly observable, we will estimate the standalone selling price using information available to us including our market assessment and/or expected cost plus margin.
The timetable for fulfilment of each of the distinct performance obligations can range from completion in a short amount of time and entirely within a single reporting period to completion over several reporting periods. The timing of revenue recognition for each performance obligation may be dependent upon several milestones, including physical delivery of equipment, completion of factory acceptance test, completion of site acceptance test, installation and connectivity of equipment, certification of training of personnel and, in the case of after-market service deliverables, the passage of time (typically evenly over the post-warranty period of the service deliverable).
 In cases where we are responsible for shipping after the customer has obtained control of the goods, we have elected to treat the shipping activities as fulfillment activities rather than as a separate performance obligation. Additionally, we have elected to capitalize the cost to obtain a contract only if the period of amortization would be longer than one year. We only give consideration to whether a customer agreement has a 
Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We restrict investments in cash equivalents to financial institutions with high credit standing. Credit risk on accounts receivable is minimized as a result of the large and diverse nature of our company&#8217;s worldwide customer base. As of June 30, 2021 and 2022, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable. In fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers&#8217; financial condition and maintain allowances for potential credit losses.
For cost, quality control, technological, and efficiency reasons, we purchase certain materials, parts, and components only from single vendors with whom we have ongoing relationships. We do, however, qualify second sources for many of our materials, parts, and components. While management believes that relying on key vendors improves the efficiency and reliability of business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of business can have a significant negative impact on revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor.
We transact business in various foreign currencies. In countries where the functional currency of the underlying operations has been determined to be the local country&#8217;s currency, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into United States dollars using average exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into United States dollars using period-end exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders&#8217; equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We also have subsidiaries where the United States dollar has been designated as the functional currency based on individual facts and circumstances. Remeasurement of non-United States dollar monetary assets and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates and associated gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using historical exchange rates. Transaction gains and losses, which were included in our consolidated statement of operations, amounted to a gain (loss) of approximately $(
&#8212;Under ASC 805, the acquisition method of accounting requires us to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed from an acquisition at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the total estimated purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired should be recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technology, trade names, useful lives and discount rates. Management&#8217;s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, as additional information that existed at the acquisition date becomes available for preliminary estimates, we may record adjustments to the preliminary assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are included in earnings.
&#8212;We offer our customers warranties on many of the products that we sell. These warranties typically provide for repairs and maintenance of the products if problems arise during a specified time period after original shipment. Concurrent with the sale of products, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses with a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold. We periodically adjust this provision based on historical experience and anticipated expenses. We charge actual expenses of repairs under warranty, including parts and labor, to this provision when incurred. 
The current obligation for warranty provision is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and the noncurrent portion is included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, whose activity for each of the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 is summarized in the following table (in thousands):
 practical expedient, which allows us to use hindsight in determining the lease term. We do not record an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability for leases with an initial term of one year or less (&#8220;short-term leases&#8221;). The terms in our leases may include options to extend or terminate the lease. We recognize ROU assets and liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. Judgment is required in our assessment as to whether renewal or termination options are reasonably certain to be exercised and factors such as contractual terms compared to current market rates and the importance of the facility and location to our operations, among others, are considered. Lease payments are made in accordance with the lease terms, and lease expense, including short-term lease expense, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We lease facilities and certain equipment under various operating lease agreements. The majority of our lease arrangements are comprised of fixed payments while certain of our other leases provide for periodic rent increases. Our leases may contain escalation clauses and renewal options. Most of the leases require us to pay for certain other costs such as common area maintenance and property taxes. Rent expense for leases with periodic rent increases or escalation clauses is recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. We also have finance leases for fleet vehicles that are not material to the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2021, we entered into an amendment to the senior secured credit facility that increased the aggregate amount available to borrow from $

Upon conversion, the original indenture provided that the Notes may be settled, at our election, in cash or shares of our Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Common Stock. We have irrevocably elected a combination settlement method to satisfy the conversion obligation, which provides for us to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash and to settle the excess conversion value, if any, in shares of Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares.
We may redeem the Notes if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock has been at least

The occurrence of a fundamental change will also result in the Notes becoming immediately convertible. Since the last reported sales price of our Common Stock did not exceed

 &#160;&#160;Expected volatility is based on implied volatility and/or our historical share price volatility matching the expected holding period. No single method of estimating volatility is proper under all circumstances and to the extent that a company can derive implied volatility based on the trading of its financial instruments on a public market, it may be appropriate to use both implied and historical volatility in its assumptions. We have certain financial instruments that are publicly traded from which we can derive the implied volatility. Therefore, we use implied and historical volatility for valuing our stock options. We believe that implied and historical volatility is a better indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility.

&#160;million, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $
&#160;million for interest and penalties. Our uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. These include fiscal years after 2019 for federal purposes, fiscal years after 2018 for state purposes and fiscal years after 2010 for various foreign jurisdictions. Facts and circumstances could arise that could cause us to reduce the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including, but not limited to, settlement of income tax positions or expiration of statutes of limitation. Since the ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions depends on many factors and assumptions, we are not able to estimate the range of potential changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits or the timing of such changes.

&#8212;In the normal course of business, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations, warranties or covenants, or intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. We have not recorded any liability for costs related to contingent indemnification obligations as of June 30, 2022.

&#8212;We are involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion after consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of such proceedings is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have not accrued for loss contingencies relating to any such matters because we believe that, although unfavorable outcomes in the proceedings are possible, they are not considered by management to be probable and reasonably estimable. If one or more of these matters are resolved in a manner adverse to our company, the impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material.
